# Mobile App Signup Flow 

## Project Overview 
* As part of my UI/UX internship, I designed the mobile app signup flow to make it easy, quick, and personalized for users to create an account and sign up for the app.

## Design Goals
* Short and sweet: Minimize the number of steps and make the process easy to follow.
* Personalized: Use user's name, location, or interests to make the experience more engaging. 
* Useful: Collect necessary information without asking for too much. 
* Error-free: Ensure a smooth process without errors or repetition. 
* Secure: Protect user's personal information.

## Design Process
* User research: Analyzed existing signup flows and identified areas for improvement.
* Wireframing: Created low-fidelity sketches of the new signup flow using Figma. 
* Prototyping: Designed high-fidelity prototypes to visualize the new flow.
* Testing: Conducted usability testing to refine the design. 

## Design Solutions 
* Simplified the signup process into 3 easy steps.
* Added personalized elements, such as using the user's name and location.
* Implemented a progress bar to show the user's progress. #Designed clear and concise error messages. 
* Ensured a secure signup flow with clear password requirements.
